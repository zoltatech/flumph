# flumph
A simple row-oriented database in Rust

*Note* - this project is in its really early stages, and at this point is more of a vehicle for me
to learn Rust than a serious and even minimally useful tool. This README will be updated when and
if the project reaches a state where it can be meaningfully consumed and used.
